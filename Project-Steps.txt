Let's break down this AWS task into a very simple, step-by-step explanation.

### The Big Picture: Building a Secure Neighborhood

Think of this entire task as building a secure, gated community (your **VPC**) inside a big city (the internet).

1.  **The Land & Fence (VPC):** First, you fence off a piece of land. This is your **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**. It's your own private, isolated section of the AWS cloud. You decide the size; here, you need space for 256 + 256 IP addresses.

2.  **The Main Gate (Internet Gateway):** To allow traffic to and from the outside world (the internet), you need a main gate. This is the **Internet Gateway (IGW)**. You attach it to your VPC's fence.

3.  **The Plots of Land (Subnets):** Inside your gated community, you divide the land into plots.
    *   **Public Subnet:** This is a plot right next to the main gate. Any house built here can easily be accessed from the outside road. It's "public-facing."
    *   **Private Subnet:** This is a plot deep inside the community, with no direct access to the main gate. Houses here are for private use and are protected from direct internet traffic.

4.  **The Street Signs (Route Table):** A **Route Table** is like a set of street signs telling traffic where to go.
    *   For the **Public Subnet**, you create a sign that says: "To go to the internet, use the Main Gate (Internet Gateway)."
    *   For the **Private Subnet**, you don't put up a sign to the main gate, so traffic there can't accidentally find its way to the internet.

5.  **The House (EC2 Instance):** Finally, you build a house. This is your **EC2 Instance** (a virtual server). You build this house on the **Public Subnet** plot, so you can reach it from the internet via SSH.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough (How to Do It)

Hereâ€™s how you would perform this task in the AWS Management Console.

#### Step 1: Create the VPC (The Gated Community)

1.  Go to the AWS VPC Console.
2.  Click "Create VPC".
3.  Choose "VPC only".
4.  Give it a name, like `My-Task-VPC`.
5.  For the **IPv4 CIDR block**, enter `10.0.0.0/16`. This gives you a huge range of over 65,000 IP addresses, which is more than enough for our two subnets.

#### Step 2: Create the Internet Gateway (The Main Gate)

1.  In the VPC Console, on the left menu, find "Internet Gateways".
2.  Click "Create internet gateway".
3.  Name it, e.g., `My-IGW`.
4.  After creating it, select it and click **"Attach to VPC"** from the "Actions" menu.
5.  Choose the `My-Task-VPC` you just created.

#### Step 3: Create the Subnets (The Plots of Land)

Now, we'll create two subnets inside our VPC.

**Public Subnet:**
1.  In the left menu, go to "Subnets".
2.  Click "Create subnet".
3.  Select your `My-Task-VPC`.
4.  Name it `Public-Subnet`.
5.  For the IPv4 CIDR block, enter `10.0.1.0/24`. This reserves 256 IP addresses for this subnet.
6.  Click "Create".

**Private Subnet:**
1.  Click "Create subnet" again.
2.  Select your `My-Task-VPC`.
3.  Name it `Private-Subnet`.
4.  For the IPv4 CIDR block, enter `10.0.2.0/24`. This reserves another 256 IP addresses.
5.  Click "Create".

#### Step 4: Create and Set Up the Route Table (The Street Signs)

By default, a main route table is created with your VPC, but it has no route to the internet. We need to make a custom one for our public subnet.

1.  Go to "Route Tables" in the left menu.
2.  Click "Create route table".
3.  Name it `Public-Route-Table` and select your `My-Task-VPC`.
4.  After creation, select this new route table and go to the **"Routes"** tab below.
5.  Click "Edit routes" -> "Add route".
    *   **Destination:** `0.0.0.0/0` (This means "all traffic not destined for the local VPC").
    *   **Target:** Select the Internet Gateway you created (`My-IGW`).
6.  Click "Save routes".

**Now, associate this route table with your Public Subnet:**
1.  In the same `Public-Route-Table` screen, go to the **"Subnet associations"** tab.
2.  Click "Edit subnet associations".
3.  Check the box next to your `Public-Subnet`.
4.  Click "Save".

*(The private subnet will use the default route table, which has no route to the IGW, so it remains private.)*

#### Step 5: Launch the EC2 Instance (Build the House)

1.  Go to the EC2 Console and click "Launch Instance".
2.  **Name:** `My-Public-Instance`.
3.  **AMI:** Choose an Amazon Linux AMI.
4.  **Instance Type:** `t2.micro` (it's free tier eligible).
5.  **Key Pair:** Select or create a new key pair (.pem file). **This is very important to connect to your instance later.**
6.  **Network Settings:** Click "Edit".
    *   **VPC:** Ensure you select `My-Task-VPC`.
    *   **Subnet:** Select your `Public-Subnet`.
    *   **Auto-assign Public IP:** Enable this. This gives your instance a public IP address so you can reach it from the internet.
    *   **Firewall (Security Group):** Create a new security group. Add a rule to allow **SSH (port 22)** from your IP address or from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`) for testing.
7.  Click "Launch Instance".

### Final Result

You have now successfully:
*   Created a secure, isolated network (VPC).
*   Gave it a gateway to the internet (IGW).
*   Created a public and a private area within it (Subnets).
*   Set up the rules for public traffic (Route Table).
*   Launched a Linux server in the public area (EC2 Instance).

You can find the public IP address of your new instance in the EC2 console, and use your key pair to SSH into it, proving it's accessible from the internet through your new VPC setup.
